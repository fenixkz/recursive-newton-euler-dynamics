# Recursive Newton-Euler algorithm 
 MatLab implementation of recursive Newton-Euler algorithm for robot dynamics. This script contains the implementation alongside with three examples how to use these functions. 
 ## Implementation details
 In order to use the functions correctly, one needs to define a data structure that describes the physical and geometrical parameters of the robot. robot

 ## First example
 A planar 2R robot is given with the following parameters:
 - q = [90, 45]
 - qdot = [-0.8, 0.35]
 - q2dot = [-0.4, 0.1]
